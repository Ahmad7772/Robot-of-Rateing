# Robot-of-Rateing
- first of all, I designed the [head]() 
- then I designed the [right hand](https://github.com/Ahmad7772/Robot-of-Rateing/blob/main/right%20hand%20v4.stl) and [left hand](https://github.com/Ahmad7772/Robot-of-Rateing/blob/main/left%20hand%20v7.stl) .
- then I designed the [base](https://github.com/Ahmad7772/Robot-of-Rateing/blob/main/base%20v1.stl) .
- then I placed motors and bearings on the head and hands with doing some changes to fit on it .
- finally, I installed them together and I get this [full body](https://github.com/Ahmad7772/Robot-of-Rateing/blob/main/FULL%20body%20v1.stl).
